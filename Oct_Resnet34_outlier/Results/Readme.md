# The results of ResNet34 with outlier

# Important Note:

  - Resnet_outlier4, 5, 6, and 7 shows train accuracy, train loss, test accuracy, and test loss, if accepted the predicted score and vision score equals to their int vales. It means <em> int(predicted_score) == int(vision_score) </em> was accepted as a correct prediction.
  
  - The png file named "Correct1_test_train_acc_loss" represented train accuracy, test accuracy, and loss, if accepted the predicted score between (vision_score - 1) and (vision_score + 1).
